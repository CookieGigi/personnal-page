      <p>
        Software engineer with 4 years of experience designing, implementing and managing web applications projects.
        My last job principally involved technologies like ASP.Net, Microsoft SQL Server, JS/JQuery and HTML/CSS, but outside
        of work, I’m an enthusiastic learner who likes to explore other languages such as Python and Rust or other domains
        like self-hosting or Linux.
        In my previous company, I was not only developer. I also had to deal with all aspect of a project including non-technical
        one like project management and client need analysis.
        I’m traveler who after traveling 9 months, search for a stable job in Malaysia.
